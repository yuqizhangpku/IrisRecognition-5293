# IrisRecognition-5293
This is a course project about iris recognition based on Python. What I do is to implement the exact same design as Ma's Paper(Personal Identification Based on Iris Texture Analysis) and focus on Image Preprocessing, Feature Extraction, and Iris Matching only using provided dataset(subset of CASIA Iris Image Database).


In the final stage, I used two methods(CRR & COR) to give an assessment for experiment results.
